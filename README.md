### MizzouSENG Political Primary Project
Our project shows primary data from the 2016 US presidental election.

The visualization I, Will Morrison, created was the 2 primary graphs. I added the democrat graph and I changed the bars colors to match the political colors of each party. After that I made the republican background gold to seperate them from the democrats.

We used the following tools:
