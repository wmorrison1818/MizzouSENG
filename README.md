### MizzouSENG Political Primary Project
Our project shows primary data from the 2016 US presidential election.

The visualization I, Will Morrison, created was the 2 primary graphs. I added the democrat graph and I changed the bars colors to match the political colors of each party. After that I made the republican background gold to separate them from the democrats.

The visualizations I, Matt Sommer, added were titles and corresponding party logos to each page.

We used the following tools:
