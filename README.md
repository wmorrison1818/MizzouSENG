### MizzouSENG Political Primary Project
Our project shows primary data from the 2016 US presidential election.

The visualization I, Will Morrison, created was the 2 primary graphs. I added the democrat graph and I changed the bars colors to match the political colors of each party. After that I made the republican background gold to separate them from the democrats.

The visualizations I, Matt Sommer, added were titles and corresponding party logos to each page.

The Visualization I, Dewi Kharismawati, organized both pages to make it more neat. I created the header, then put the logos and titles added by Matt into the center of the header. Also, I created container to hold the graphs added by Will to make them look tidier. Use bootstrap on the button to make the visualization even better.
